The 'Fake-Fire' mod was originally created by Semmett9.

URL to the 'Fake-Fire' thread on Minetest.net:
http://forum.minetest.net/viewtopic.php?id=6145

I've customized it a bit. Please see the changelog.txt file for more details.

~ LazyJ, 2014_03_15

The lines below, at the end, are from the original author, Semmett9.

Thanks for a nice mod, Semmett9. ;)

~ LazyJ, 2014_03_14

-- Thanks-

-- Many thanks for addi for his help in coding. --

-- Many thanks for the players on the King Arthur's land server for giving --
-- me support, ideas and allowing me to add the mod to the server itself. --

						These next two "and nots" tell Minetest not to put the
						red	flame on snow and ice stuff. This "string" bit was
						the workable solution that took many hours, over
						several days, to finally come around to. It's a search
						for any node name that contains	whatever is between the
						double-quotes, ie. "snow" or "ice". I had been trying
						to identify the nodes by their group properties	and I
						couldn't figure out how to do it. The clue for the
						"string"came from Blockmen's "Landscape" mod.
				
						Another quirk is that the "string" doesn't work well
						with variable lists (see "snow_ice_list") when using
						"and not". Ice-fire would light on snow but when I
						clicked on ice, the regular	flame appeared. I couldn't
						understand what was happening until	I mentally changed
						the wording "and not" to "is not" and spoke	out-loud
						each thing that line of code was to accomplish:
				
						"Is not snow, then make fake-fire."
						"Is not ice, then make fake-fire."
				
						That's when I caught the problem.
				
						Ice *is not* snow, so Minetest was correctly following
						the	instruction, "Is not snow, then make fake-fire."
						and that is	why	fake-fire appeared instead of ice-fire
						when I clicked on ice.
